## Target Audience

I would like my portfolio to be primarily a way to reach out to fellow front-end web developers and project managers both in Australia and other English-speaking countries abroad. I want to showcase my projects - flaws and all - in order to exchange ideas and learn from the online community. 

Also, I would like to use a unique but accessible web page design layout as a calling-card to attract prospective employers in start-ups and SMEs by showcasing my ability to translate my interface aesthetics in a functional, tested product. I would like to demonstrate to recruiters and hiring managers that I am bringing aboard a mature and current design aesthetic with the coding abilities to bring it to life using current frameworks and coding practices.
